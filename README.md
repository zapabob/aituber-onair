> **Build stream-ready AI VTubers with TypeScript**
>
> AITuber OnAir is an open source toolkit for building AI VTubers
> that can chat, speak, react to viewers, use memory, and run with
> PNG, VRM, or Live2D avatars. Start from the hosted web app, scaffold
> a starter app, self-host a working example, or assemble your own stack
> from modular TypeScript packages.

## What you can build

- AI VTubers that chat and speak with live viewers
- Streaming assistants that react to YouTube / Twitch comments
- AI character apps with text, voice, vision, and long-term memory
- Viewer relationship systems with points, levels, and achievements
- Browser- and Node.js-based integrations, composed from independent packages

## Start in 10 minutes

If you want the shortest path to a local AI VTuber:

```bash
npm create aituber-onair@latest my-aituber
cd my-aituber
npm run dev
```

Then open the app, choose a template, and configure your LLM / TTS provider
from **Settings**. See the [Quickstart](./docs/quickstart.md) for the full
walkthrough.

## Choose your path

### 1. Try the hosted web app

[AITuber OnAir](https://aituberonair.com) is a full, standalone AITuber streaming web app built on top of `@aituber-onair/core`. It's both the quickest way to experience the toolkit end-to-end and a working reference for what you can ship with it. No setup required.

### 2. Create a starter app

Use `create-aituber-onair` to scaffold your own app from an official PNGTuber,
VRM, or Live2D starter template.

```bash
npm create aituber-onair@latest
```

The CLI asks for a project name, template, and whether to install
dependencies. You can also pass the project name up front:

```bash
npm create aituber-onair@latest my-aituber
cd my-aituber
npm run dev
```

For step-by-step setup and template selection, see
[Quickstart](./docs/quickstart.md).

### 3. Run an example app locally

Four full, ready-to-run React apps built on `@aituber-onair/core`. Pick the
avatar style that fits your project. All four share the same broad LLM / TTS
provider coverage and in-app **Settings** UI.

#### PNGTuber Chat — 2D PNG avatar

![PNGTuber example app](./packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app/images/react-pngtuber-app.png)

Swap in 4 PNG states (mouth/eyes open/close) and get real-time lip-sync driven from actual audio output. See [`packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app`](./packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinshin86/aituber-onair.git
cd aituber-onair/packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### VRM Chat — 3D VRM avatar

![VRM example app](./packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app/images/react-vrm-app.png)

Render a 3D VRM avatar (`miko.vrm`) with optional idle VRMA animation, real-time mouth lip-sync driven from audio output, and camera controls (drag to rotate / wheel to zoom). See [`packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app`](./packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinshin86/aituber-onair.git
cd aituber-onair/packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### FBX Chat — 3D FBX avatar

Render your own FBX character (`avatar.fbx`) with optional `idle.fbx` and
`talk.fbx` animation clips, audio-driven mouth/jaw motion, procedural idle
motion, emotion-tag expression morphs, camera controls, and the same YouTube /
Twitch live-comment pipeline.
See [`packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app`](./packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinshin86/aituber-onair.git
cd aituber-onair/packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Live2D Chat — local Live2D folder loader

![Live2D example app with Hiyori Momose](./packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app/images/react-live2d-app-hiyori.png)

<p align="center">
  <small>
    Live2D sample model: Hiyori Momose. Illustration: Kani Biimu;
    Modeling: Live2D Inc. This content uses sample data owned and copyrighted
    by Live2D Inc. See
    <a href="https://www.live2d.com/en/learn/sample/">Live2D Sample Data</a>.
  </small>
</p>

Load a local Live2D model folder that contains `.model3.json`, render it in
the browser, and drive mouth movement from actual audio output volume. This
example intentionally does not bundle any Live2D assets. See
[`packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app`](./packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinshin86/aituber-onair.git
cd aituber-onair/packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in any case, then set API keys and provider options in **Settings**.

See [Examples](./docs/examples.md) for the full example map and recommended
starting points.

### 4. Build your own with the packages

Install only what you need and drop it into your own app:

```bash
npm install @aituber-onair/chat
```

```ts
import { ChatServiceFactory } from '@aituber-onair/chat';

const chat = ChatServiceFactory.createChatService('openai', {
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
});

await chat.processChat(
  [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
  (partial) => process.stdout.write(partial),
  async (full) => console.log('\nDone:', full),
);
```

See each package README for provider setup and fuller usage.

## Why AITuber OnAir

- Proven in production — powers [AITuber OnAir](https://aituberonair.com), a live AITuber streaming web app, so you're building on the same code path a real product ships on
- Pick any entry point: hosted web app, starter CLI, self-hosted example, or modular npm packages
- First-class coverage of the providers AITuber builders actually use — OpenAI / Claude / Gemini for chat, VOICEVOX / OpenAI TTS / AIVIS Speech and more for voice
- Chat, voice, streaming (YouTube / Twitch / WebSocket), and viewer relationships in a single, consistent stack
- MIT-licensed TypeScript — you keep control of hosting, data, and integrations

npm run fmt
```

### Agent Skills

Shared Agent Skills so Codex and Claude Code use the same workflow definitions.
See [`docs/agent-skills.md`](./docs/agent-skills.md) for the full guide. Canonical sources live in `skills/`, with Claude Code runtime copies under `.claude/skills/`.

### Releases

Releases are driven by manual version bumps + per-package `CHANGELOG.md`, published automatically by GitHub Actions on merge to `main`. Do **not** run `npm publish` directly.

- **Patch**: bug fixes, dependency updates
- **Minor**: new features, backward-compatible changes
- **Major**: breaking changes to public API

`release.yml` uses Changesets to publish packages, create tags (`@aituber-onair/<pkg>@x.y.z`), and create GitHub Releases for packages published in that run. If CI fails mid-run, re-running publishes the remainder but does **not** backfill Releases for already-published packages — create those manually from the package CHANGELOG (tag will already exist). `prerelease-next.yml` only updates the `next` prerelease tag.
