# Agent Skills in This Repository

This repository manages Agent Skills with an open SKILL.md format and keeps
Codex and Claude Code usage aligned.

## Layout

- Canonical skill source:
  `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Codex UI metadata:
  `skills/<skill-name>/agents/openai.yaml`
- Claude Code runtime skill:
  `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

`SKILL.md` is the shared source of truth for skill behavior. Keep frontmatter
minimal (`name`, `description`) and keep the body procedural.

Use `add-chat-model` when adding a new model id to `@aituber-onair/chat`,
including constants, provider support, tests, examples, docs, and versioning
updates.
Before adding or reorganizing LLM/TTS models, read
`docs/agent-model-provider-guidelines.md` to classify the model or API as
recommended/default, supported/explicit, deprecated compatibility, or
candidate-only.
Use `add-tts-provider` when adding a new voice/TTS provider to
`@aituber-onair/voice`, including engine implementation, public option types,
internal handler wiring, tests, docs, examples, and release prep. This also fits
OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoints such as `<openai-compatible-tts-endpoint>` when
they should be added as a dedicated provider.
Use `sync-core-after-chat-upgrade` after chat upgrades to propagate changes
into `@aituber-onair/core` and core examples.
Use `wrap-tts-as-openai-compatible` when exposing a local or self-hosted TTS
runtime through an OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/speech` server, including
JSON request handling, browser CORS, Colab-friendly setup, upstream TTS pattern
classification, and debugging of 422/500/runtime issues. This skill also
includes validation guidance for consuming the wrapper from
`@aituber-onair/voice`. It is optimized for practical local TTS engines rather
than research-first or streaming-first systems.
Use `create-pngtuber-avatar-states` when creating PNGTuber avatar state images, including 2x2 state sheets, mouth/eye open-close variants, background transparency, alignment, and validation. The image generation phase requires Codex with ImageGen or an equivalent image-generation tool. In Claude Code, use this skill only for existing image files: splitting, background transparency when appropriate, alignment, and validation.
Use `connect-colab-local-tts` when driving
`shinshin86/local-tts-on-google-colab` through Colab MCP Go, exposing the
selected engine with `trycloudflare`, and validating the resulting
OpenAI-compatible speech endpoint from `@aituber-onair/voice`.
Use `connect-colab-local-llm` when launching a user-selected local LLM on
Google Colab through Colab MCP Go and connecting it to a Core React sample.
The skill uses vLLM for native Hugging Face generation checkpoints and
llama.cpp for GGUF files. It creates a temporary connection URL and API key,
checks normal and streaming responses, and verifies the result in Core. The
user only copies the endpoint, model, and key into the Core sample.

### Google Colab Local LLM Quick Start

Before starting:

1. Open a Google Colab notebook.
2. Select and connect a GPU runtime. The Gemma 4 example below uses L4.
3. Make sure Colab MCP Go can access the notebook so that Codex can operate it.

Whether L4 is sufficient depends on the model and settings. For another model,
the agent checks the connected GPU before setup.

Then copy this request into Codex:

```text
Use $connect-colab-local-llm to launch the verified Gemma 4 12B Q4_0 setup
on the connected Google Colab L4 runtime.

Connect it to the AITuber OnAir Core PNGTuber sample, verify that Japanese
responses appear incrementally in the browser, and show me the three values I
need to enter in Core. Keep the session running after validation so that I can
try it myself.
```

The agent installs the required software, downloads and verifies the model,
creates a protected temporary connection, and checks the Core sample. It then
returns:

- the full `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint
- the exact served model name
- the temporary API key

Enter those values in the Core sample with Provider set to
`OpenAI-Compatible`. Start with TTS Engine set to `None` when validating text
generation. The URL and key expire when the temporary connection or Colab
runtime stops.

For generic GGUF, vLLM, automatic backend selection, and cleanup prompts, see
[`skills/connect-colab-local-llm/references/request-examples.md`](../skills/connect-colab-local-llm/references/request-examples.md).

## Usage

Codex prompt examples:

- "add a new model"
- "support model <provider-model-id>"
- "add claude model"
- "update supported models"
- "add a TTS provider"
- "support Acme TTS in voice"
- "add <provider> TTS"
- "wrap a TTS engine as OpenAI-compatible"
- "build an OpenAI-compatible speech server in Colab"
- "connect Colab local TTS to AITuber OnAir voice"
- "create PNGTuber avatar state images from this character"
- "generate mouth and eye open-close variants for react-pngtuber-app"
- "launch local-tts-on-google-colab with Colab MCP Go"
- "Use $connect-colab-local-tts to launch <local-tts-engine> from
  local-tts-on-google-colab through Colab MCP Go, expose it with trycloudflare,
  and verify it from @aituber-onair/voice."
- "launch vLLM on Google Colab with Colab MCP Go"
- "launch a GGUF model with llama.cpp on Google Colab"
- "connect a Colab local LLM to the Core PNGTuber sample"
- "Use $connect-colab-local-llm to set up the verified Gemma 4 configuration
  on an L4 runtime and keep it running for browser testing."
- "Use $connect-colab-local-llm to run <hugging-face-model-id> on Colab,
  choose the appropriate backend, and verify it with react-pngtuber-app."

Claude Code prompt examples:

- "Use $add-chat-model to add <provider-model-id> for <provider>."
- "Use $add-chat-model and wire the model through tests/docs/versioning."
- "Use $sync-core-after-chat-upgrade for chat 0.15.0."

## Task Prompt Templates

Use these when you want a copy-pasteable prompt for a specific workflow.

### PNGTuber Avatar Assets

```text
Use $create-pngtuber-avatar-states to create four PNGTuber avatar state images from the attached character image.

Requirements:
- Save outputs under `outputs/pngtuber-avatar/<name-or-date>/`.
- Create these files:
  - `mouth_close_eyes_open.png`
  - `mouth_open_eyes_open.png`
  - `mouth_close_eyes_close.png`
  - `mouth_open_eyes_close.png`
- Preserve the character, expression direction, hairstyle, outfit, composition, and background mood as much as possible.
- Change only the mouth and eyes between states.
- If the source image has a meaningful background, keep it. If it has a plain white/chroma-key background intended as a cutout, remove it.
- Check and correct position jitter between the four states.
- Report the saved paths and validation result.
```

If the request does not include all required inputs, collect:
`provider`, `model_id`, `model_const_name`, `display_name`,
`supports_vision`, and optional `bump_version` (default `false`; set `true`
only when release/version work is explicitly requested).

Handoff rule:

- After finishing `$add-chat-model`, ask whether to run
  `$sync-core-after-chat-upgrade`.
- If the user already requested chat + core propagation in one task, continue
  directly without asking again.
- When `$add-tts-provider` performs voice release prep, keep version/changelog
  changes scoped to `@aituber-onair/voice`. Do not bump `@aituber-onair/core`
  or `create-aituber-onair` for dependency alignment unless the user explicitly
  requests those package releases in the same task.
- After voice release prep, ask before starting core propagation/release work;
  treat it as a separate follow-up unless it was explicitly requested up front.

## Update Workflow

1. Edit canonical file:
   `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Sync to Claude Code path:
   `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
3. If needed, update Codex metadata:
   `skills/<skill-name>/agents/openai.yaml`
4. Update references in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` if behavior changed.

Recommended sync check:

```bash
diff -u skills/add-chat-model/SKILL.md .claude/skills/add-chat-model/SKILL.md
diff -u skills/add-tts-provider/SKILL.md .claude/skills/add-tts-provider/SKILL.md
