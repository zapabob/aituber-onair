AITuber OnAir includes full app examples and smaller package examples. If you
are new to the project, start with one full AI VTuber app first, then move down
to the package examples when you need lower-level integration.

## Recommended Path

- Start with
  [`packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app)
  if this is your first AITuber OnAir project.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app)
  if you want a 3D avatar with VRM assets.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app)
  if you already have an FBX character and animation clips for a 3D streaming
  avatar.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app)
  if you already have Live2D model assets.
- Use package examples when you want to embed chat, voice, memory, or streaming
  behavior into an existing application.

## Full AI VTuber Apps

### PNGTuber App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app/images/react-pngtuber-app.png" alt="PNGTuber example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app)

Best for a first local setup. It uses 2D PNG avatar states and drives lip sync
from actual audio output volume.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### VRM App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app/images/react-vrm-app.png" alt="VRM example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app)

Best for 3D avatar projects. It renders a VRM model, supports optional idle
VRMA animation, and includes camera controls.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### FBX App

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app)

Best when you already have an FBX character rig. It loads `avatar.fbx`,
optionally blends `idle.fbx` and `talk.fbx`, and drives mouth or jaw motion
from audio output volume. It also blends matching expression morph targets from
screenplay emotion tags during speech.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Live2D App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app/images/react-live2d-app-hiyori.png" alt="Live2D example app with Hiyori Momose" width="720" />

  </small>
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app)

Best when you already have Live2D assets. The example loads a local Live2D model
folder and drives mouth movement from audio output volume. Live2D model assets
are not bundled.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
