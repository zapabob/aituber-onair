AITuber OnAir includes full app examples and smaller package examples. If you
are new to the project, start with one full AI VTuber app first, then move down
to the package examples when you need lower-level integration.

## Recommended Path

- Start with
  [`packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app)
  if this is your first AITuber OnAir project.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app)
  if you want a 3D avatar with VRM assets.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app)
  if you already have an FBX character and animation clips for a 3D streaming
  avatar.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-pet-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-pet-app)
  if you want a small animated pet that reacts to chat state.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app)
  if you already have Live2D model assets.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-purupuru-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-purupuru-app)
  if you want a 2D avatar with hair physics and rich idle motion out of the box.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-inochi2d-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-inochi2d-app)
  if you want an experimental Inochi2D avatar with a prebuilt runtime.
- Use
  [`packages/core/examples/react-psd-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-psd-app)
  if you want a PSDTool-style or Anime2.5DRig-compatible 2D tachie avatar from
  a single PSD file.
- Use package examples when you want to embed chat, voice, memory, or streaming
  behavior into an existing application.

## Full AI VTuber Apps

### PNGTuber App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app/images/react-pngtuber-app.png" alt="PNGTuber example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app)

Best for a first local setup. It uses 2D PNG avatar states and drives lip sync
from actual audio output volume.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### PuruPuru PNGTuber App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-purupuru-app/images/react-purupuru-app.png" alt="PuruPuru PNGTuber example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-purupuru-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-purupuru-app)

Best when you want a lively 2D avatar without preparing tracking or 3D assets.
It loads a single-file `.purupuru` avatar package and drives idle motion,
blinking, audio lip-sync, hair spring physics, idle gaze turns, and
emotion-driven reactions. Miko, the official AITuber OnAir character, is
bundled as the default avatar. The `.purupuru` avatar format was created by
rotejin in [PuruPuruPNGTuber](https://github.com/rotejin/PuruPuruPNGTuber);
this example is an AITuber-oriented reimplementation.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-purupuru-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Inochi2D App (experimental)

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-inochi2d-app/images/react-inochi2d-app.png" alt="Inochi2D example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-inochi2d-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-inochi2d-app)

Best for trying Inochi2D avatars. It renders an Inochi2D model on a WebGL stage
using a prebuilt Inochi2D runtime and drives mouth movement from audio output
volume. It bundles the Aka Inochi2D model for first-run display, and you can
also load a local `.inx` / `.inp` file or register another model in
`public/inochi2d/manifest.json`.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-inochi2d-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Pet App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-pet-app/images/react-pet-app.jpg" alt="Pet example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-pet-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-pet-app)

Best for a lightweight animated companion. It renders a Codex Pet-compatible
spritesheet, moves the pet around the stage, and switches animations from chat
state, reply mood, and real-time audio volume.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-pet-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### VRM App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app/images/react-vrm-app.png" alt="VRM example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app)

Best for 3D avatar projects. It renders a VRM model, supports optional idle
VRMA animation, and includes camera controls.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### FBX App

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app)

Best when you already have an FBX character rig. It loads `avatar.fbx`,
optionally blends `idle.fbx` and `talk.fbx`, drives mouth or jaw motion from
audio output volume, and blends matching expression morph targets from
screenplay emotion tags during speech.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-fbx-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Live2D App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app/images/react-live2d-app-hiyori.png" alt="Live2D example app with Hiyori Momose" width="720" />
</p>

<p align="center">

    by Live2D Inc. See

  </small>
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app)

Best when you already have Live2D assets. The example loads a local Live2D model
folder and drives mouth movement from audio output volume. Live2D model assets
are not bundled.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### PSD Tachie App

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/core/examples/react-psd-app/images/react-psd-app.webp" alt="PSD Tachie example app" width="720" />
</p>

Path:
[`packages/core/examples/react-psd-app`](../packages/core/examples/react-psd-app)

Best when you want to load a PSDTool-style or Anime2.5DRig-compatible 2D tachie
avatar from one PSD file. It composites PSD layers on canvas, drives mouth and
eye layers with lip-sync and blinking, and includes a bundled motion sample
that works with zero setup.

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-psd-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Starter Templates

<p align="center">
  <img src="../packages/create-aituber-onair/images/create-aituber-onair.png" alt="create-aituber-onair" width="520" />
</p>

Use `create-aituber-onair` when you want a clean project outside this monorepo:
