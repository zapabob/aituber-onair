description: Apply released @aituber-onair/chat updates to @aituber-onair/core and core React examples, including dependency alignment, core re-exports, example model lists, docs, version/changelog, lockfiles, and verification. Use after chat package upgrades or when users ask to propagate chat changes into core.

# Sync Core After Chat Upgrade

## Overview

Propagate chat package upgrades into core and related examples so users can use
new chat capabilities from `@aituber-onair/core` immediately.

## Inputs

Collect missing inputs before editing:

- `chat_version`: target chat version already published to npm (example:
  `0.15.0`)
- `core_next_version`: optional explicit target core version (example:
  `0.23.1`)
- `bump_version`: boolean, default `true`
- `update_docs`: boolean, default `true`
- `update_examples`: boolean, default `true`

## Procedure

1. Preflight:
   - Inspect `packages/chat/package.json` and `packages/core/package.json`.
   - Confirm the exact target version is already available from the public npm
     registry (for example,
     `npm view @aituber-onair/chat@<chat_version> version`).
   - Treat Chat -> Core as a hard release-order gate. Do not prepare or release
     Chat and Core in the same PR. If the target Chat version is unavailable,
     stop Core release work until the Chat release succeeds.
   - Read `packages/chat/CHANGELOG.md` latest entry and list what must surface
     in core (new constants/models/provider behavior).
   - List `packages/core/examples/*/package-lock.json` files and identify every
     lockfile that embeds the local `@aituber-onair/core` workspace metadata.
2. Align core dependency:
   - Update `packages/core/package.json` dependency
     `@aituber-onair/chat` to include `^<chat_version>` when needed.
3. Update core public exports:
   - Edit `packages/core/src/index.ts` to re-export newly relevant chat
     constants/types/providers that should be available from core.
   - Keep ordering consistent with nearby export groups.
4. Update core examples when `update_examples` is `true`:
   - `packages/core/examples/react-basic/src/constants/*.ts`:
     add/replace model constants so new chat models are selectable.
   - For `packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app`,
     `packages/core/examples/react-pet-app`,
     `packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app`,
     `packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app`, and
     `packages/core/examples/react-purupuru-app`, check whether the chat change
     requires defaults, model selectors, settings UI, or docs updates. These
     apps usually use free-form model input rather than fixed chat model lists,
     so code changes are only needed when behavior or defaults must change.
5. Update docs when `update_docs` is `true`:
   - `packages/core/README.md`
   - `packages/core/README_ja.md`
   - `packages/core/examples/react-basic/README.md`
   - `packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app/README.md` (if relevant)
   - `packages/core/examples/react-pet-app/README.md` (if relevant)
6. Versioning when `bump_version` is `true`:
   - Choose bump type:
     - patch for dependency/export alignment and non-breaking propagation.
     - minor only when core public behavior/features are expanded.
   - Use `core_next_version` if provided; otherwise compute next version.
   - Update `packages/core/package.json` version.
   - Add release note entry to `packages/core/CHANGELOG.md`.
7. Lockfiles:
   - Update root `package-lock.json`.
   - Update every core example lockfile that embeds local core workspace
     metadata, not just examples with code changes. At the time of writing this
     includes:
     - `packages/core/examples/react-basic/package-lock.json`
     - `packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app/package-lock.json`
     - `packages/core/examples/react-pet-app/package-lock.json`
     - `packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app/package-lock.json`
     - `packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app/package-lock.json`
     - `packages/core/examples/coding-agent/package-lock.json`
   - After updating, search all `packages/core/examples/*/package-lock.json`
     files for stale `@aituber-onair/core` versions or stale
     `@aituber-onair/chat` dependency ranges.
8. Verify:
   - `npm -w @aituber-onair/core run test`
   - `npm -w @aituber-onair/core run build`
   - `npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-basic run build`
   - `npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app run build`
   - If Pet, VRM, Live2D, coding-agent, or their lockfiles changed, also run:
     - `npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-pet-app run build`
     - `npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app run build`
     - `npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app run build`
     - `npm --prefix packages/core/examples/coding-agent run build`
   - Starter/template smoke tests must install the published Chat dependency
     from npm while using the local Core release-candidate tarball. Do not
     inject a local Chat tarball: doing so can hide an unpublished or incorrect
     Core dependency range.
9. Final check:
   - Confirm newly added chat models/features are reachable from core exports
     and visible in examples.

## Verification Commands

Run commands from repository root:

```bash
npm -w @aituber-onair/core run test
npm -w @aituber-onair/core run build
npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-basic run build
npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-pngtuber-app run build
# Also run these when the corresponding example or lockfile changed:
npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-pet-app run build
npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-vrm-app run build
npm --prefix packages/core/examples/react-live2d-app run build
npm --prefix packages/core/examples/coding-agent run build
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Core depends on the intended chat version range.
- The target Chat version is already published to npm before the Core release
  PR is prepared.
- Required new chat constants/features are re-exported from core.
- Core examples can select/use newly propagated models as needed.
- Core docs reflect the updated provider/model coverage.
- Core version/changelog and all core example lockfiles that embed local core
  metadata are consistent when `bump_version` is `true`.
- No core example lockfile still references the previous core version or stale
  chat version range.
- Core tests/build and affected example builds pass.
