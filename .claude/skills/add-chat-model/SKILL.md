description: Add a new chat model id to @aituber-onair/chat and wire it through constants, provider implementation, tests, example UI selector, docs, and versioning updates. Use when requests include adding a new model, supporting a specific model id, adding a provider model, or updating supported models for providers such as claude, gemini, and openai.

# Add Chat Model

## Overview

Add a new model id for an existing chat provider and complete all required
code, test, docs, and version updates in one pass.

Before adding any model to a supported list, read
`docs/agent-model-provider-guidelines.md`. A model is not eligible for
`getSupportedModels()` unless the exact endpoint family used by the provider is
documented or live-verified for that model.

This skill is a `@aituber-onair/chat` model-addition and optional
`@aituber-onair/chat` release-prep workflow. It is not a multi-package release
workflow. When release work is requested for a chat model addition, the only
package that should receive a version bump and changelog entry from this skill
is `@aituber-onair/chat`. Dependent packages may need dependency range and
root lockfile updates for install consistency, but they must not be treated as
release targets. Example lockfiles are updated only when their own manifests or
an explicitly requested core propagation change requires it.

## Inputs

Collect missing inputs before editing:

- `provider`: one of `claude`, `gemini`, `openai`, or another existing provider
- `model_id`: model id string (example: `provider-chat-model-id`)
- `model_const_name`: exported const name (example:
  `MODEL_PROVIDER_CHAT_MODEL`)
- `display_name`: UI label (example: `Provider Chat Model`)
- `supports_vision`: boolean
- `api_version_hint`: optional hint for API version routing (example:
  `v1beta only`, `v1 preferred`, `unknown`)
- `bump_version`: boolean, default `false`; set `true` only when the user
  explicitly requests release/version work
- `next_version`: optional, explicit target version (example: `0.15.0`)

## Procedure

1. Run preflight checks before editing:
   - Read `docs/agent-model-provider-guidelines.md` and classify the candidate
     as recommended/default, supported/explicit, exported deprecated
     compatibility, or candidate-only.
   - Search for existing candidate notes or research notes:
     `rg "<model_id>|<provider>|candidate|research|notes" docs skills .claude`.
     Treat any matches as non-authoritative until official docs or live API
     behavior re-confirm them.
   - Grep existing usage to avoid duplicate work:
     `rg "<model_id>" packages/chat`.
   - Inspect provider constants and provider `getSupportedModels()` before
     adding anything.
   - If the model already exists, stop and switch to gap-fix mode
     (tests/docs/versioning only if missing).
2. Validate API family and user-facing eligibility before changing supported
   lists:
   - Confirm whether the model must use a specific API version or endpoint
     flavor (for example Gemini `v1` vs `v1beta`).
   - Confirm the provider docs or live API behavior show this model working
     with the same endpoint family used by the current service implementation
     (for example Chat Completions vs Responses vs legacy completions).
   - Confirm request fields, response shape, streaming format, tool-call
     format, and vision input format match the current provider parser.
   - Confirm users can configure the model through package options and relevant
     example UI without undocumented setup.
   - Do not continue to step 3 when only a global model page confirms that the
     model exists.
   - If any hard gate fails, keep the candidate as candidate-only or
     export-only compatibility and do not add it to `getSupportedModels()` or
     example selectors.
   - Treat `api_version_hint` as a starting point, then verify in provider docs
     or behavior.
3. Locate the provider constants file and add:
   - `export const <model_const_name> = '<model_id>';`
   - Keep ordering consistent with neighboring entries.
   - For `claude`, edit `packages/chat/src/constants/claude.ts`.
4. If `supports_vision` is `true`, add the new constant to the provider vision
   list.
   - For `claude`, update `CLAUDE_VISION_SUPPORTED_MODELS`.
5. Update provider implementation so supported models include the new constant.
   - For `claude`, edit
     `packages/chat/src/services/providers/claude/ClaudeChatServiceProvider.ts`.
6. Update provider tests:
   - Assert supported models include the new constant.
   - If `supports_vision` is `true`, assert `supportsVisionForModel` is `true`
     for that model.
   - For `claude`, edit
     `packages/chat/tests/providers/ClaudeChatServiceProvider.test.ts`.
7. Add or update service-level transport tests for request routing:
   - Verify actual request path/version selection (not only provider model list).
   - Verify the model id is sent through the intended endpoint family.
   - Verify parser behavior still matches the response shape for that endpoint.
   - If special routing is required, update service request routing logic.
   - Include fallback behavior tests when applicable (for example `v1` to
     `v1beta`).
8. Update example model selector:
   - Edit
     `packages/chat/examples/react-basic/src/components/ProviderSelector.tsx`.
   - Add a new `allModels` entry:
     - `id: <model_const_name>`
     - `name: <display_name>`
     - `provider: '<provider>'`
     - `default: false`
   - Keep import ordering consistent with nearby models.
9. Update docs using this checklist:
   - `packages/chat/README.md`
     - provider-specific usage/model section
     - "Available Providers" model list
   - `packages/chat/README.ja.md`
     - provider-specific usage/model section
     - "利用可能なプロバイダー" model list
   - If model lists appear in examples docs, update:
     `packages/chat/examples/react-basic/README.md`
10. If `bump_version` is `true`, prepare release updates for
   `@aituber-onair/chat`:
   - Decide next version:
     - Use `next_version` if provided.
     - Otherwise use a minor bump for new model support unless repository rules
       differ.
   - Update `packages/chat/package.json` version.
   - Update `packages/chat/CHANGELOG.md` for the target version:
     - If a section for `next_version` already exists, append to it.
     - Do not create duplicate headers for the same version.
   - Align dependent ranges:
     - Update `packages/core/package.json` dependency
       `@aituber-onair/chat` to the new range (for example `^0.14.0`).
     - Update other direct workspace dependents of `@aituber-onair/chat` only
       when their `0.x` dependency range would not include the new chat
       version.
     - Do not bump dependent package versions only for dependency range
       alignment.
     - Do not add dependent package changelog entries only for dependency range
       alignment.
     - In particular, do not bump or add release notes for
       `@aituber-onair/core`, `@aituber-onair/noise`, or
       `create-aituber-onair` unless the user explicitly asks to release those
       packages or a separate package-specific skill requires it.
     - If a dependent package test fails because you accidentally changed that
       package's version, revert the version/changelog change rather than
       expanding the release scope.
   - Update lockfiles affected by version/range changes:
     - Always refresh the repository root `package-lock.json` after changing
       package versions or direct workspace dependency ranges.
     - Update a package/example lockfile only when its own `package.json`
       changed or an explicitly requested propagation task requires it.
     - Do not mechanically refresh `packages/core/examples/*/package-lock.json`
       only because their embedded `file:../..` workspace metadata reflects the
       new chat version. These files trigger `Create Template Smoke` through
       `.github/workflows/create-template-smoke.yml`.
     - Before the new chat version is published, that smoke workflow packs
       `@aituber-onair/core` locally but resolves its chat dependency from the
       npm registry. If a core example lockfile refresh changes the embedded
       range to the unreleased version, all generated starters fail with
       `ETARGET: No matching version found for @aituber-onair/chat@^<version>`.
     - If core example changes are genuinely required, use
       `$sync-core-after-chat-upgrade` and ensure the smoke flow provides the
       unreleased chat package as a local tarball, or keep the propagation
       separate until the chat version is published. Do not rely on the npm
       registry to resolve an unreleased workspace version.
   - Follow repository rule: do not create `.changeset/*`.
11. Verify:
   - Compare the branch against its base and remove incidental core example
     lockfile-only changes before committing:
     `git diff --name-only origin/main -- packages/core/examples`.
   - Run lockfile/install sanity check.
   - Run chat package tests.
   - Run typecheck/build for chat package.
   - Run core typecheck to ensure dependency range updates are valid.
   - Grep for `model_id` to confirm expected placements and no duplicates.
12. Prepare final commit:
   - Use a release-prep message such as:
     `chore(release): prepare @aituber-onair/chat v<next_version>`.
   - Keep release-prep changes (version/changelog/lockfiles) in the same commit.
13. Offer core propagation handoff:
   - After chat-side work is complete, ask:
     "Run `$sync-core-after-chat-upgrade` now to propagate this chat upgrade
     into `@aituber-onair/core` and core examples?"
   - If the user agrees, execute that skill next with the same target
     `chat_version`.
   - Skip the question only when the user already requested end-to-end chat+core
     propagation in the same task.
   - Do not silently perform core propagation or core release work as part of
     this skill.

## Verification Commands

Run commands from repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm -w @aituber-onair/chat run test
npm -w @aituber-onair/chat run typecheck
npm -w @aituber-onair/chat run build
npm -w @aituber-onair/core run typecheck
git diff --name-only origin/main -- packages/core/examples
rg "<model_id>" packages/chat
rg "v1beta|streamGenerateContent|generateContent" packages/chat/src/services/providers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- New model constant exists and is exported.
- Provider supported models contain the new model only when endpoint-family
  compatibility is documented or live-verified.
- If vision is enabled, vision support list contains the model and related tests
  pass.
- Example selector displays the model label.
- Service request routing matches model API requirements (version/endpoint).
- Service-level tests cover request path/version and fallback behavior when used.
- Final notes include the model decision record from
  `docs/agent-model-provider-guidelines.md`.
- English and Japanese README mention the model.
- Version and changelog are updated when `bump_version` is `true`.
- `@aituber-onair/core` dependency range is aligned to the new chat version.
- Lockfiles are consistent and `npm ci` succeeds.
- No incidental `packages/core/examples/*/package-lock.json` refresh causes
  template smoke tests to resolve an unreleased chat version from npm.
- The user is asked whether to run `$sync-core-after-chat-upgrade` after chat
  updates finish (unless already requested explicitly).
