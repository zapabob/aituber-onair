# PSD Format Support

This example has two PSD paths:

- **Motion auto-rig mode** for flat Anime2.5DRig-compatible PSDs.
- **Static PSDTool mode** for PSDTool-style layer trees.

The app always tries motion detection first. If the loaded PSD is not eligible
for motion, it falls back to static mode.

## Decision Flow

1. The selected `.psd` is inspected by `src/lib/rig/anime25Rig.ts` with the
   vendored rigger in `src/vendor/anime25drig/rigger.js`.
2. Motion mode is selected when the rigger produces a normalized `face` part.
   Eye, mouth, and hair parts add their corresponding motion capabilities but
   are not required. Missing optional parts and incomplete eye anchors remain
   visible as non-blocking diagnostic warnings.
3. Otherwise the app parses the file with `@webtoon/psd` and uses static
   PSDTool mode.

When a PSD falls back to static mode, **Settings -> Visual** shows the static
mode status and the motion rejection reason. In the Japanese UI this appears as
`静的モード` and `モーション判定の詳細`.

## Motion Mode Layer Specification

Motion mode uses only flat pixel layers. Grouped PSDs are rejected by the
vendored rigger with:

```text
レイヤーが見つかりません（グループは未対応・フラット構成にしてください）
```

Layer names are normalized by `normName` in `rigger.js`:

- Unicode is normalized with `NFKC`.
- Leading/trailing whitespace is removed.
- Japanese copy suffixes like ` のコピー 12` are stripped.
- Names are lower-cased.
- Only trailing numeric suffixes in the form `_<number>` are stripped by
  `baseName` after alias resolution.

### Recognized Input Names

| Input name | Eligibility | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `face` | Required | Main face region and face anchor source. |
| `eyewhite` | Optional | Split internally into visible left/right eye whites and used to derive eye anchors. A single detected side is supported. |
| `irides` | Optional | Split internally into visible left/right irises for gaze motion. |
| `eyelash` | Optional | Split internally into visible left/right open-eye lashes. |
| `mouth_open` | Optional | Enables the open-mouth side of audio-driven lip sync. |
| `front hair` | Optional | Hair layer with physics. Numbered variants are allowed. |
| `back hair` | Optional | Hair layer with physics. Numbered variants are allowed. |
| `mouth_close` | Optional | Used for closed-mouth shape and may help mouth anchor placement. |
| `eye_close` | Optional | Split internally into left/right closed eyes. If missing, blink falls back to compressing eye-open layers. |
| `eyebrow` | Optional | Split internally into left/right brows. |
| `nose` | Optional | Follows face/head deformation. |
| `ears` | Optional | Follows face/head deformation. |
| `neck` | Optional | Body-side part. |
| `topwear` | Optional | Body-side part. |
| `bottomwear` | Optional | Body-side part. |
| `handwear` | Optional | Body-side part. |
| `earwear` | Optional | Head-side accessory. |
| `headwear` | Optional | Head-side accessory. |
| `facedetail` | Optional | Face-side detail. |

Aliases verified from the vendored rigger:

| Input name | Normalized as |
|---|---|
| `eyelash_c` | `eye_close` |
| `mouth_c` | `mouth_close` |
| `mouth`, `mouth 2`, `mouth_3`, `mouth-4` | `mouth_open` |
| `レイヤー 1` | `facedetail` |

Hair strand names can use underscore numbering such as `front hair_1` or
`back hair_12`. The rigger strips the trailing `_<number>` for slot lookup and
uses numbered hair layers for strand grouping. Hyphen numbering such as
`front hair-1` is not stripped.

### Motion Naming Pitfalls

- Input split-eye layers should use the base names `eyewhite`, `irides`,
  `eyelash`, `eye_close`, and `eyebrow`. The rigger splits them into left and
  right parts internally.
- `eyewhite_l`, `irides_r`, `eyewhite-l`, and `irides-r` are not recognized
  input slot names by the vendored rigger.
- Unknown names are demoted to `body` or `head` placement and produce a
  diagnostic warning like `未知のレイヤー名 "..." — head/body として扱います`.
- If the rigger derives only one eye anchor, the detected side keeps its eye
  motion and the unavailable side is skipped. The incomplete-anchor warning is
  diagnostic and does not disable motion mode.

## Motion Profiles

The **PSD motion tuning** section appears under **Settings -> Visual** only
while a motion-mode PSD is loaded. Slider changes are applied through the
renderer's dynamic profile API, so the existing rig, meshes, textures, and
animation loop stay alive. With no saved profile, or with every control at its
default, rendering matches the original motion-mode defaults.

The adjustable parameters are:

| Group | Parameters |
|---|---|
| Face / body | `angleX`, `angleY`, `angleZ`, `body`, `armY`, `armPos` |
| Eyes / brows | `eyeOpenL`, `eyeOpenR`, `eyeX`, `eyeY`, `irisScale`, `eyeEase`, `eyeCY`, `eyeCAng`, `eyeScaleL`, `eyeScaleR`, `brow`, `browAngL`, `browAngR`, `browAngSym` |
| Mouth | `mouthOpen`, `mouthForm`, `mouthCY`, `mouthEase`, `mouthCAng`, `mouthScale` |
| Hair / physics | `physAmp`, `soft`, `fhAmp`, `fhSoft`, `bangL`, `bangC`, `bangR`, `bust`, `bustY` |

`angleX`, `angleY`, `angleZ`, `body`, `armY`, and `armPos` are base offsets
added to automatic movement. `mouthOpen` is a baseline; while TTS lip sync is
active, the renderer uses the larger of the baseline and audio input. No random
demo lip sync is generated.

The `idle`, `randomMotion`, `blink`, and `physics` automation switches are
stored per PSD. The existing `PSD motion` setting remains the master switch.
`Motion intensity` scales automatic movement and physics in addition to the
profile's individual amplitude controls.

### PSD identity and automatic storage

The app calculates the content hash with
`crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', buffer)`. The hash, rather than the file name
or size, selects the motion profile, including for the bundled sample. Identical
PSD content therefore restores the same profile after a rename, while different
content with the same name and size does not collide.

`layerSignature` is a SHA-256 of a canonical description containing the canvas
width/height and every rig layer's normalized name, array order, and
integer-rounded `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` bounds. It is used only for
import compatibility checks; the full PSD content hash remains the storage key.

Motion profiles use the dedicated localStorage key
`react-psd-app-psd-motion-profiles-v1`. Its value has this structure:

```ts
{
  format: 'aituber-onair-psd-motion-profile-store';
  version: 1;
  profiles: Record<string, {
    parameters: PsdMotionParameters;
    automation: {
      idle: boolean;
      randomMotion: boolean;
      blink: boolean;
      physics: boolean;
    };
  }>;
}
```

Each `profiles` key is a lower-case 64-character PSD SHA-256. Slider and
checkbox changes are saved immediately. **Reset to defaults** deletes the
current hash entry. Invalid or unavailable localStorage falls back to defaults
without preventing the PSD from rendering. This store is separate from the
existing static PSDTool visibility/role store.

### JSON sidecar export and import

**Export motion settings** downloads UTF-8, formatted JSON named
`<PSD-name>.motion.json`. The version 1 file schema is:

```ts
interface PsdMotionProfileFile {
  format: 'aituber-onair-psd-motion-profile';
  version: 1;
  exportedAt: string;
  model: {
    sha256: string;
    width: number;
    height: number;
    layerSignature: string;
    fileNameHint?: string;
  };
  parameters: PsdMotionParameters;
  automation: {
    idle: boolean;
    randomMotion: boolean;
    blink: boolean;
    physics: boolean;
  };
}
```

The sidecar contains no PSD pixels, API keys, localStorage dump, absolute
paths, chat/voice settings, or camera/microphone/mouse state. It is not XMP and
is never embedded into or written back to the PSD.

Imports are limited to 64 KB. The parser requires the exact `format` and
`version`, rebuilds the profile from allowed properties only, rejects
non-finite/non-number values, clamps ranges, and ignores unknown properties.
Compatibility is decided as follows:

| Imported identity | Result |
|---|---|
| SHA-256 matches | Apply immediately and save for the current PSD. |
| SHA-256 differs; canvas and `layerSignature` match | Show a different-file warning and apply only after explicit confirmation. |
| Canvas or `layerSignature` differs | Show an incompatibility error and do not apply. |

To move settings to another browser or PC, export the sidecar, load the target
motion PSD there, and then import the JSON. Motion profile import/export is not
available in static PSDTool mode.

## Static PSDTool Mode

Static mode renders a PSD layer tree with `@webtoon/psd` and canvas
compositing. It supports the PSDTool-like name markers implemented in
`src/lib/psdModel.ts` and `src/lib/psdVisibility.ts`.

| Notation | Support | Behavior |
|---|---:|---|
| Leading `!` | Supported | Forced visible. The node is always composited and has no checkbox. |
| Leading `*` | Supported | Radio item. Making one visible hides sibling radio items in the same parent. |
| `:flipx` | Parsed only | Removed from the display name; no horizontal flip is applied. |
| `:flipy` | Parsed only | Removed from the display name; no vertical flip is applied. |
| `:flipxy` | Parsed only | Removed from the display name; no flip is applied. |

Radio initial visibility is normalized per sibling set: the first visible radio
item remains visible and later visible radio siblings are hidden.

Role auto-detection is implemented in `src/lib/psdBinding.ts`:

| Role | Group hints | Layer hints |
|---|---|---|
| `mouthOpen` | `口`, `mouth`, `くち` | `開`, `あ`, `open` |
| `mouthClosed` | `口`, `mouth`, `くち` | `閉`, `ん`, `close`, `むっ` |
| `eyesOpen` | `目`, `eye`, `め` | `開`, `open` |
| `eyesClosed` | `目`, `eye`, `め` | `閉`, `close`, `つぶり` |

The layer tree and role controls are shown only when
`hasPsdToolLayerControls(model)` is true. That requires at least one group,
radio node, or forced-visible node. A plain flat PSD without PSDTool controls is
still rendered, but the detailed layer tree UI is hidden.

## Limitations

These limits apply to this example unless noted otherwise:

- The UI accepts `.psd` files. PSB is not supported or tested by this example.
- The known-good format is an 8-bit RGB PSD with normal pixel layers. The
  static parser exposes broader PSD header enums, but this example's rendering
  path is verified for 8-bit RGB/grayscale layer pixels. The motion path is
  verified for 8-bit RGB flat pixel layers.
- Non-normal blend modes are parsed but rendered as normal alpha compositing.
- Layer masks and vector masks are ignored.
- Clipping masks are ignored.
- Adjustment/effect layers are not rendered as Photoshop effects.
- `:flip*` variants are parsed but not visually flipped.
- PSDTool faview/simple-view metadata is not supported.
- Motion mode has idle and breathing motion. Hair, eye, blink, and mouth motion
  are applied when their corresponding layers can be detected. It has no camera
  tracking.

If a PSD fails with color mode or bit depth errors, export it again as an
8-bit RGB `.psd`.

## Troubleshooting

| Message | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `missing part: face` | The required face motion slot was not found after rigger name normalization. | Rename the main flat face pixel layer to `face`, or use static PSDTool mode. |
| `未知のレイヤー名 "..." — head/body として扱います` | The layer name is not in the rigger slot table or alias table. Motion mode can still run when `face` is present. | Rename it to a recognized base name when it should receive part-specific motion. Avoid side suffixes such as `eyewhite_l` and hyphenated names such as `eyewhite-l`. |
| `目のアンカーが不完全です（eyewhite/irides を確認）` | Eye anchor detection found only one side or no usable eye components. Motion mode can still run. | No change is needed for a deliberate single-eye/profile avatar. Otherwise, make `eyewhite` and `irides` flat pixel layers with separable eye components. |

## Bundled Samples

`public/avatar/sample.psd` is a procedurally drawn motion-mode demo. It is
generated from 10 transparent PNG parts drawn by
`scripts/draw_doodle_parts.py` and assembled by `scripts/build-doodle-sample.mjs`.
The PSD uses a fixed 1024x1536 canvas and these bottom-to-top flat layer names:

```text
back hair
topwear
face
mouth_open
eyewhite
eyelash
irides
front hair
mouth_close
eye_close
```

Regenerate it with:

```bash
uv run --with pillow python scripts/draw_doodle_parts.py local-assets/doodle-parts
npm run build:doodle-sample
```

The static PSDTool notation demo is `public/avatar/sample-static.psd`. Load it
from **Settings -> Visual -> PSD avatar** when you want to inspect layer-tree,
radio, forced visibility, and role-assignment behavior. Its verified layer tree
is:

```text
ROOT
  口
    *開き
    *閉じ
  目
    *閉じ
    *開き
  !body
```

The `口` and `目` groups demonstrate radio items. `!body` demonstrates forced
visibility. Regenerate it with:

```bash
npm run generate:static-sample
```

The motion detector rejects `sample-static.psd` because it has no flat `face`
motion part. A rig smoke check reports `!body` as an unknown layer and reports
incomplete eye and mouth anchors, so the app correctly uses static mode.
