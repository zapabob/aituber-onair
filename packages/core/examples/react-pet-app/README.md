# Pet Chat

Web Speech API TTS is available with browser voice selection and rate, pitch,
volume, and language controls. Because the browser plays it directly without
exposing audio bytes, lip sync is not supported when this engine is selected.

An AITuber chat sample that renders a Codex-style animated pet instead of a
static PNGTuber avatar.

The app keeps the same basic structure as the other React core samples:

- LLM chat through `@aituber-onair/core`
- xAI Grok 4.5 exposes `reasoning_effort` and defaults to `low`; Grok 4.3 defaults to `none` for lower latency
- TTS playback and real-time audio analysis
- Speech input through Web Speech API
- YouTube Live / Twitch comment ingestion
- Manual OBS Virtual Camera frame capture through **Settings → Screen Vision**
  for vision-capable model comments
- Green screen background mode and a solo broadcast layout with pet-only
  captions from **Settings → Visual**
- Comment intelligence and manneri detection

## Screen Vision

Start OBS Virtual Camera, choose it from **Settings → Screen Vision**, then press
**画面を見る** to send the current frame to the selected vision-capable model.
You can also choose an automatic interval such as 30 seconds, 1 minute,
2 minutes, or 5 minutes.

## Broadcast visuals

Use **Settings → Visual** to switch the background to green screen and select
the solo broadcast layout. In solo broadcast layout, the normal chat log is
hidden and only the pet's latest spoken text is shown as a lower caption. The
user input field is hidden by default, but can be enabled in the same Visual
settings section.

## Pet animation

The pet is loaded from:

```text
public/pet/pet.json
public/pet/spritesheet.webp
```

The included sample uses an 8x9 Codex Pet spritesheet with 192x208 cells.
Rows are interpreted as:

| Row | State |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | idle |
| 1 | running-right |
| 2 | running-left |
| 3 | waving |
| 4 | jumping |
| 5 | failed |
| 6 | waiting |
| 7 | running |
| 8 | review |

During chat, the pet reacts to app state:

- Processing: review animation
- Speaking: waving / jumping based on audio volume
- Happy replies: runs around the stage
- Failed or apologetic replies: failed animation

## Setup

```bash
cd packages/core/examples/react-pet-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open Settings and configure LLM / TTS providers.
Settings are saved in `localStorage` under `react-pet-app-settings`.
The LLM section also lets you edit the system prompt. It is applied when the
field loses focus and is saved with the other settings.

## Replacing the pet

Open the Pet section in Settings to register another Codex Pet-compatible
package. Select `pet.json` and the spritesheet image, then press Register. The
custom pet is stored in the browser and remains active after a reload.

Use the reset button to return to the bundled Miko pet.

The manifest should look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "miko",
  "displayName": "Miko",
  "description": "A tiny animated pet.",
  "spritesheetPath": "spritesheet.webp"
}
```

For development-time defaults, replace `public/pet/pet.json` and
`public/pet/spritesheet.webp`.

Keep generated or local-only pet assets out of commits unless you have the
right to redistribute them.

## Bundled Miko asset terms

The default Pet spritesheet depicts Miko, the official character of AITuber
OnAir. It is not covered by the software's MIT License. See
[Miko Asset Terms](./MIKO_ASSET_TERMS.md) for a link to the
authoritative Japanese guidelines. The asset may be distributed as an integral part of a
work or other content, but standalone redistribution and asset collections are
prohibited.
