# Character Support Bot

An `@aituber-onair/core` example that combines a product landing page with a
floating, speaking character support widget.

Open the widget to meet Miko, a bundled `.purupuru` avatar. The browser-side
core streams chat through a same-origin OpenAI-compatible route, sends the
completed screenplay to a same-origin speech route, plays the returned audio
bytes, and uses Web Audio amplitude analysis for lip sync. Emotion tags from
`SPEECH_START` also drive PuruPuru reactions, while the renderer keeps its idle
motion and blink behavior. The widget frames the full-height source art as a
chest-up portrait. Browsers that expose the Web Speech API also get key-free
microphone dictation with live interim text.

## Security warning

> **Do not expose `/admin` or this demo server to the public internet.**

The admin page is intentionally unauthenticated for local example use. It can
write provider credentials to `server/data/settings.json`. Before adapting this
example for a real deployment, add authentication, authorization, CSRF
protection, rate limits, network restrictions, and a deployment-appropriate
secret store.

The example enforces one useful boundary even in local development:

- LLM and TTS keys are saved only in the gitignored server settings file.
- Admin GET responses contain masked key values only.
- The browser bundle creates `AITuberOnAirCore` with an empty key.
- Browser chat and speech requests never include provider credentials.
- The Node server adds credentials only to its upstream provider requests.
- The selected EN/JA display language is the only preference stored in browser
  `localStorage`.

## Architecture

```text
Browser
  SpeechRecognition / webkitSpeechRecognition
    microphone -> interim and final text -> composer (no automatic send)
  AITuberOnAirCore
    chatProvider: openai-compatible
      -> POST /api/support/chat/completions?language=en|ja (no key)
    voice engine: openaiCompatible
      -> POST /api/support/tts (no key)
      <- audio bytes -> Web Audio playback + lip sync

Node server
  /api/support/chat/completions
    -> @aituber-onair/chat -> configured LLM provider
    <- OpenAI-compatible SSE
  /api/support/tts
    -> @aituber-onair/voice -> configured server-capable voice engine
    <- audio bytes
```

The server replaces browser-supplied system messages with a server-owned
persona, support rules, emotion-tag contract, and curated Core package
knowledge.

## Language switching

The EN/JA controls on the landing page, support widget, and admin page share
one display-language preference. The initial value follows `navigator.language`
when no preference has been saved, and later selections are stored in browser
`localStorage`.

The selected language controls three parts of the example together:

- All landing page, widget, status, voice-input, and admin UI copy.
- Web Speech API recognition locale (`en-US` or `ja-JP`). Active recognition
  restarts with the new locale when the language changes.
- Miko's response language. The browser passes the selected language to the
  same-origin chat proxy, and the server adds the matching language instruction
  to its protected system prompt.
- The built-in admin persona. English and Japanese defaults follow the selected
  display language; a saved persona that the user edited is left unchanged.

Provider keys, persona text, and other server settings are not stored in
browser storage.

By default, the server prompt asks Miko to answer in one to three natural
spoken sentences. She gives more detail when the user explicitly asks for it.

## Voice input

The microphone button uses the browser's `SpeechRecognition` or
`webkitSpeechRecognition` implementation. It does not call a server-side STT
service and does not require an API key.

- Interim recognition results appear live in the message composer.
- Final text remains in the composer until the user presses Send or Enter.
- The short placeholder stays on one line and truncates with an ellipsis when
  the composer is narrow.
- Recognition pauses between Core's `SPEECH_START` and `SPEECH_END` events so
  Miko does not transcribe her own TTS output. It resumes afterward when the
  microphone toggle is still active.
- The recognition language follows the EN/JA display-language selection.
- Permission denials and recognition errors leave normal text input available
  and show a small status message instead of repeatedly logging errors.

The microphone control is shown only when the Web Speech API is available. It
is generally available in Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome and Edge, but
not in Firefox. Browser implementations may use an online recognition service,
so review browser privacy behavior before production use.

## Run locally

From this example directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

- Landing page and widget: `http://localhost:5173`
- Server settings: `http://localhost:5173/admin`

`npm run dev` launches both Vite and the zero-dependency Node HTTP server. The
Node server listens on `127.0.0.1:8788` by default. Override it with
`CHARACTER_SUPPORT_BOT_PORT`; update `vite.config.ts` when changing the local
proxy port.

## Configure providers

Open `/admin` and configure both sections.

### LLM

The server uses `ChatServiceFactory` from `@aituber-onair/chat`, so the admin
page discovers the package's registered server-capable providers and models.
OpenAI-compatible servers accept a full Chat Completions URL and an arbitrary
model ID.

### TTS

The server discovers engines from `@aituber-onair/voice` capabilities and uses
the package's adapters for synthesis. The general rule is that an engine must
run in a Node/server runtime and return audio bytes to the same-origin speech
route.

The current server-capable engines are VOICEVOX, VOICEPEAK, OpenAI, xAI,
Unreal Speech, ElevenLabs, Inworld, Gradium, Gemini TTS, OpenAI-compatible,
AivisSpeech, Aivis Cloud API, and MiniMax. The built-in mock remains available
for local playback and lip-sync checks.

Browser-only PiperPlus and Web Speech are excluded. The `none` engine is also
excluded because it intentionally returns no audio. `/api/admin/providers`
includes these exclusion reasons alongside the selectable providers.

VOICEVOX and AivisSpeech use configurable local endpoints without API keys.
For providers with a voice-list API, `/admin` automatically loads choices on
page load and provider changes. The field hides the raw saved ID while loading,
then becomes a select box that shows voice and style names while saving the
corresponding ID. A saved ID that is missing from the latest list remains
available as an unknown saved option. If the API is unreachable or returns no
voices, the field falls back to editable voice or speaker ID input with a retry
button. Providers without a voice-list API use that input immediately. Endpoint
edits do not trigger another request; use the reload button when needed.
Providers with speed control use a slider with the supported range and current
multiplier shown. Provider credentials are used only by the Node server.

The browser always uses Core's `openaiCompatible` voice engine against the
local proxy, regardless of which upstream TTS provider the server uses.

## Local mock flow

The repository includes a mock OpenAI-compatible chat server. From the
repository root, run:

```bash
node packages/chat/examples/mock-openai-server/server.js --port=18080
```

In `/admin`, choose:

- LLM provider: `OpenAI-Compatible`
- Model: `mock-chat-model`
- Endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:18080/v1/chat/completions`
- API key: `test-key`
- TTS provider: `Built-in mock (development)`

This exercises the full browser Core flow without calling a paid API:
streaming chat, assistant events, generated audio bytes, playback, blink/idle
animation, and audio-driven lip sync.

## Build and verify

```bash
npm run fmt
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

After building, `npm run server` serves `dist` and the API together at
`http://127.0.0.1:8788`.
