# @aituber-onair/voice

## Unreleased

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- Add browser-native Web Speech API support via `engineType: 'webSpeech'`.
  - Introduce `WebSpeechEngine` for browser `speechSynthesis` playback,
    including voice selection by `SpeechSynthesisVoice.name` or `voiceURI`.
  - Add self-playing voice engine support in `VoiceEngineAdapter` for engines
    that play audio directly instead of returning audio bytes.
  - Support `webSpeechRate`, `webSpeechPitch`, `webSpeechVolume`, and
    `webSpeechLanguage` options.
  - Add Web Speech voice-list support through `getVoiceEngineVoiceList()`,
    including browser `voiceschanged` handling for delayed voice population.
  - Update the React voice example with automatic Web Speech voice loading,
    sample-side language filtering, and browser-only setup notes.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- Add engine capability and voice-list introspection helpers.
  - Export `getVoiceEngineCapabilities()` and
    `getAllVoiceEngineCapabilities()` so apps can inspect static engine
    metadata before synthesis.
  - Export `getVoiceEngineVoiceList()` to fetch normalized `{ id, label }`
    voice choices for VOICEVOX, AivisSpeech, Aivis Cloud, xAI, ElevenLabs,
    Inworld, and Gradium.
  - Update the React example to use the shared voice-list helper instead of
    duplicating provider-specific fetch logic.
  - Keep MiniMax on documented system voice ID presets because the linked
    dynamic voice-list API is currently unavailable.
  - Mark Aivis Cloud as voice-list capable at the package level while keeping
    browser examples on manual model UUID entry because model search can fail
    browser CORS checks.
  - Prefer `Response.arrayBuffer()` in OpenAI TTS response handling for better
    browser and Node compatibility.

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Gradium TTS support via `engineType: 'gradium'`.
  - Introduce `GradiumEngine` using the one-shot Gradium REST endpoint without
    adding the Gradium SDK.

    `gradiumTemperature`, `gradiumVoiceSimilarity`,
    `gradiumPaddingBonus`, and `gradiumRewriteRules`.
  - Register Gradium in the voice engine factory, public exports, internal
    option handlers, README, and tests.
  - Update the React example with Gradium flagship voice presets so browser
    users can select readable names while sending voice IDs internally.

    internal option handlers, React example, README, and tests.
- Add ElevenLabs Text to Speech support via `engineType: 'elevenLabs'`.
  - Introduce `ElevenLabsEngine` using the ElevenLabs Text to Speech API
    without adding the ElevenLabs SDK.
  - Support `elevenLabsApiUrl`, `elevenLabsModel`,
    `elevenLabsOutputFormat`, `elevenLabsLanguageCode`,
    `elevenLabsVoiceSettings`, individual voice-setting overrides,
    generation context, text normalization, and logging controls.
  - Add React example voice-list fetching from ElevenLabs Voices API so users
    can select voices by readable names while using `voice_id` internally.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- Add weighted VoicePeak emotion overrides while keeping the existing
  single-tag API backward compatible.
  - Introduce `VoicepeakEmotionInput` and
    `VoicepeakEmotionWeights` public types.
  - Accept either a single legacy tag or weighted emotion map through
    `voicepeakEmotion`.
  - Require `vpeakserver >= v0.2.0` for weighted emotion serialization.
  - Ignore `neutral`, ignore zero weights, and allow `{}` to suppress
    emotion output without falling back to `Talk.style`.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for `gemini-3.1-flash-tts-preview` in Gemini TTS.
  - Promote Gemini 3.1 Flash TTS Preview to an explicit supported model and
    make it the default model for `GeminiTtsEngine`.
  - Expand the React example with the latest Gemini prebuilt voice list and

  `nijivoice` engine type and `voiceActor` parameter).

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for MiniMax speech-2.6 HD/Turbo models and update docs plus defaults accordingly.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: introduce asynchronous speech queueing to support chunked playback
  - `VoiceEngineAdapter` now prefetches audio buffers per chunk and enqueues playback so long responses can start speaking immediately while later parts render in the background.
  - Added graceful cancellation when `stop()` is invoked and improved error handling for both fetch and playback stages.
  - This update keeps the public `VoiceService` API unchanged, so standalone consumers benefit from smoother playback without code changes.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- docs: add per-engine parameter reference and highlight new 0.5.0 overrides in English/Japanese README

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- feat: expand engine parameter coverage (all engines except NijiVoice) so developers can tune key overrides directly from the React example while leveraging existing `VoiceServiceOptions`

  **Engine highlights:**

  - **OpenAI TTS** — surfaced `openAiSpeed` override; UI defaults remain at 1.0 with real-time adjustment.
  - **VOICEVOX** — exposed full query overrides including speed/pitch/intonation/volume scales, phoneme lengths, pause controls, sampling rate, stereo, katakana-English handling, interrogative upspeak, and core version.
  - **AivisSpeech** — matched VOICEVOX-style controls for speed, pitch, intonation, volume, silence lengths, sampling rate, and channel selection.
  - **Aivis Cloud** — added most frequently requested sliders for speaking rate, emotional intensity, tempo, pitch, volume, leading/trailing/line-break silence plus output format options.
  - **VoicePeak** — enabled emotion selection alongside slider-based speed and pitch overrides to mirror the engine's API ranges.
  - **MiniMax** — reorganized voice/audio settings with sliders for speed, volume, pitch, and dropdowns for sample rate, bitrate, format, and channel while keeping language boost configurable.

- feat: refresh the React example UI to introduce reusable slider components, reset buttons, and collapsible cards that keep each engine's extended parameter set tidy and discoverable.
